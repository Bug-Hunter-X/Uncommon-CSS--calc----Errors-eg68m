The solution involves ensuring proper spacing within the `calc()` function when combining different units and operators. Also, ensure all units involved in the `calc()` function are compatible or can be easily converted to a common unit to avoid browser misinterpretations. For example, the following code demonstrates the correct usage:

```css
.element {width: calc(50% + 10px);}
.anotherElement { height: calc(100vh - 50px); }
```

In the first example, there's a space before and after the `+` operator. In the second example, we are using compatible units (`vh` and `px`). Always ensure the units in your `calc()` functions are compatible or can be converted for reliable results.
