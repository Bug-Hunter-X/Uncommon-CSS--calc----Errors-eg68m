The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, a common error arises when using the `calc()` function with percentages and other units without proper spacing. For example, the following code will produce unexpected results:

```css
.element {width:calc(50%+10px);}
```

The correct way to use this is:

```css
.element {width: calc(50% + 10px);}
```
Notice the spaces added before and after the `+` operator. Without the spacing, the browser might interpret it incorrectly.

Another error involves using `calc()` with different units without the correct calculation. For example:

```css
.element {width:calc(50%+10em);}
```

The browser may not correctly convert `50%` and `10em` to a common unit. Ensure that units are compatible for correct calculations.
